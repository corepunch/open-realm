# UI Screen Authoring

## FDF-Driven Layout

- In client/UI code, never define or hardcode UI elements, layout coordinates, textures, frame names, or control structures that can be read from FDF. Parse and reuse the actual FDF frames/templates, then bind dynamic data into those frames.
- The only exception is selected game code under `games/<game>/game/`, where there is no FDF parser. Server-authored gameplay HUD payloads may generate simple proxy frames there when needed.

## Screen Controller Conventions

- In `games/warcraft-3/ui/screens/*.c`, prefer `UI_FRAME(...)` and `UI_CHILD_FRAME(...)` for readability and FDF-name coupling.
- Use `UI_FindChildFrame(...)` when it is clearly shorter or cleaner than introducing temporary macro-bound locals.
- Avoid excessive pointer null-check noise in screen controllers. Prefer one scene-level readiness gate (early return) over repeated per-widget checks.
- If a required root frame is missing, fail fast for that screen and skip further scene setup/update work.
- Keep frame names data-driven by FDF; avoid hardcoded lookup strings when macro-based lookup can use the frame identifier directly.
